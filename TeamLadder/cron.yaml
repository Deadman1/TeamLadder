#You can control here how often your website will check for updates to games.
#The default is 6 hours. You can adjust it, but do NOT set this to a value 
#lower than 3 hours for multi-day games. Setting this lower than 3 hours puts 
#strain on the WarLight.net website, since it has to call the API to get the status of 
#every active game in your CLOT every time it runs.  Calling the APIs too often
#will get you in trouble.

#For real-time games, you can set this as low as 10 minutes.  However, if you do
#this, be sure and enable auto-boot for your games, and take care that you only 
#query games that need querying. For example, don't query games once they're finished, 
#and if a game gets stuck in the lobby be sure and delete it so you don't query 
#the same games over and over every 10 minutes for hours on end unnecessarilly
